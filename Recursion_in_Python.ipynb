For e.g. if you modify line 6 with fun(-4) you will never reach line 3 (return 1) because you started n with a negative number (-4) and you will decrement the number by 1 at each recursion and therefore n==1 (line 2) will never be true. Try your code with 0 or any negative number, and your function will loop until you reach RecursionError (maximum recursion depth exceeded...)."

Last thing to keep in mind is that when we use recursive functions, all the returned valued from intermediate function call are cached in memory, and all the calculations are shifted to the end before exiting the main function call. This makes the recursive function take up more memory space, and even be inefficeint compared to for-loop or a while-loop."
